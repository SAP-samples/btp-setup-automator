As an alternative for the btp-setup-automator we recommend to use the [Terraform Provider for SAP BTP](https://github.com/SAP/terraform-provider-btp) as tool for the setup of infrastructure on the SAP BTP available in the [Hashicorp Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/SAP/btp/latest).


### Description

This repository provides the user with a script to **automate the setup** of an [SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) account](https://account.hana.ondemand.com/) and to **learn** how this is done with the various command line interfaces and tools that run inside a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container. It uses  JSON configuration files to automate this setup of SAP BTP accounts or do other administrative tasks.

This includes:

- Setup of your SAP BTP account
- Entitlement of services
- Subscriptions to applications and creation of service instances with service keys
- Addition of administrator users to global account and sub accounts
- Setup of roles and role collections, assignment of roles collections to users
- Deployment of complete applications
- Unrolling created setup

# Instructions for running the SAP Discovery Center Mission in btp-setup-automator

The deployment of this SAP Discovery Center Mission (available soon) can be executed by the [Setup Automator for SAP Business Technology Platform](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-setup-automator). Until the SAP Discovery Center Mission is available, please check the related SAP-Samples GitHub repository ([click here](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-cf-cap-multitenant-susaas/)) for more information about this use-case.

The [Setup Automator for SAP Business Technology Platform](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-setup-automator) is an open source project to help developers setting-up their SAP BTP accounts quickly via various command line interfaces. The current script is designed to set up a SaaS provider subaccount and to spin up the application. Afterward, an initial consumer subaccount including a SaaS subscription and a SaaS API Service Broker instance is created. 

The script will create a subaccount with the necessary entitlements and deploy the Sustainable SaaS (SusaaS) application to SAP BTP. Furthermore, a Consumer Subaccount will be created and the SusaaS application will be subscribed to. Check the documentation ([click here](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-cf-cap-multitenant-susaas/)) to find out about the service instances and subscriptions created by SAP BTP Automator in the different scopes.


## Prerequisites

To use the tooling you first need to finish the following tasks:

* Get a [productive SAP BTP account](https://account.hana.ondemand.com/#/home/welcome) where you can make use of Free (Tier) service plans.
* [Install a Docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)

> **Important** - Be aware of the terms of Docker for usage in an enterprise context. For details see this [link](https://www.docker.com/blog/updating-product-subscriptions/).


## Change the configuration

Currently, the **Basic Scope** and of this use-case is optimized for Free (Tier) service plans and we recommend using a productive SAP BTP Pay-as-you-Go (PAYG) or CPEA account. Before you start the SAP BTP Setup Automator, please update the parameters.json and usecase_free_tier.json files as described in the **Instructions** section. Therefore, you either need to attach to the running container instance or edit the files in your command line terminal.

The following placeholders have to be replaced:

**parameters.json**

* \<susaas-consumer-subaccount-name\> - Subaccount name of the Consumer Subaccount created by the SAP BTP Automator (e.g., SusaaS-Consumer).
* \<btp-global-admin-user-email\> - E-mail address of a Global Account Administrator in your SAP BTP landscape that will be injected automatically to the SusaaS Credential Store instance as *btp-admin-user* and is required for automation purposes when subscribing a new tenant.
* \<btp-global-admin-user-password\> - Password of a Global Account Administrator in your SAP BTP landscape that will be injected automatically to the SusaaS Credential Store as *btp-admin-user* instance and is required for automation purposes when subscribing a new tenant.

    > **Important** - Automating the creation of these SAP BTP Global Account Administrator credential values in the Credential Store should only be done in development or test environments! Please note, the respective values will be written to the logs of your container instance. So please **delete the environment variables** lines for BTP_ADMIN_USER and BTP_ADMIN_PASSWORD in the parameters.json file **in a production scenario**. Either maintain the required values manually in the Credential Store manually as explained in the documentation or read the values from an external secure source by adjusting the init-cred-store.js file!

* \<admin-email-address-??\> - E-mail of Subaccount Admins and Cloud Foundry Org/Space Managers.
* \<developer-email-address-??\> - E-mail of Cloud Foundry Space Developers.
* \<auditor-email-address-??\> - E-mail of Cloud Foundry Space Auditors.

    > **Important** - Make sure to add the SAP Alert Notification technical user as an Auditor for your dedicated region here (e.g.,  sap_cp_us10_ans@sap.com for the us10 region). Find further details in SAP Help ([click here](https://help.sap.com/docs/ALERT_NOTIFICATION/5967a369d4b74f7a9c2b91f5df8e6ab6/4255e6064ea44f20a540c5ae0804500d.html?locale=en-US)).

* \<susaas-consumer-admin-email-address-??\> - E-mail of SusaaaS Consumer Admins.
* \<susaas-consumer-member-email-address-??\> - E-mail of SusaaaS Consumer Members.
* \<susaas-consumer-extension-dev-email-address-??\> - E-mail of SusaaaS Consumer Extension Developers.

**uscase_basic_free_tier.json**

* <your-HANA-Cloud-password> - DBADMIN user password of the SAP HANA Cloud instance setup by SAP BTP Setup Automator.


Furthermore, the name of the Provider Subaccount is preconfigured to **SusaaS-Provider** and the SAP BTP Setup Automator will deploy the use-case to the **us10** region (see parameters.json file). In case you need to adapt some of these standard SAP BTP Setup Automator parameters (like target region) you can also parse them via command line parameters when you call the script, for example, to change the region it would look like this:

```bash
./btpsa -parameterfile 'usecases/released/discoverycenter/4064-cap-saas-cf/parameters.json' -usecasefile 'usecases/released/discoverycenter/4064-cap-saas-cf/usecase_basic_free_tier.json' -globalaccount '<your global account subdomain as shown in the SAP BTP cockpit>' -myemail '<your email address>' -region 'region for your subaccount'
```

> **Hint** - We also support a deployment of the **Basic Scope** to Trial environments. Please change the above command accordingly, to use the correct usecase json file (see further details below).

To make changes to the **usecase.json** files, you can either attach Visual Studio Code (VS Code) directly to your container or edit the files in your command line terminal using for example **vi**. Then you can perform the changes in both JSON files and run the script as described above. Please be aware, that the changes are not persisted if you terminate the docker container, so make sure to also persist them somewhere else for your reference!

In case you need to perform permanent changes to either the usecase json-files or the parameter.json file you need to create your own docker image containing the changes as described [in the documentation](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-setup-automator/blob/main/README.md#option-2-start-docker-container-with-self-built-image) for more details.


**Usecase files**

Besides a usecase file for deploying the **Basic Scope** of the use-case to an SAP BTP account supporting **Free (Tier) service plans** ([usecase_basic_free_tier.json](usecase_basic_free_tier.json)), for this scope, we also provide a usecase file for **Trial** environments ([usecase_basic_trial.json](usecase_basic_trial.json)). 


**Region Change**

Be aware in case you change the region for the use-case you need to have a look at the [Available Regions here](https://help.sap.com/products/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/557ec3adc3174ed4914ec9d6d13487cf.html?locale=en-US&version=Cloud). To make sure the use-case is executable you need to check if the [SAP HANA Cloud availability](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/sap-hana-cloud?region=all&tab=service_plan) is given.


## Instructions

Open a command line terminal on your machine or directly from within Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

> **Hint** - In case you don't know how to do it, here are the instructions for [MS Windows](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-Terminal-in-Windows), [Mac OS](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Terminal-Window-in-Mac) and [Ubuntu Linux](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Terminal-Window-in-Ubuntu).

Enter the following command into the terminal and press the `ENTER` key. This will spin up a new *btp-setup-automator* docker container in **detached** mode by using the **-d** parameter.

```bash
docker container run --rm -it -d --name "btp-setup-automator" "ghcr.io/sap-samples/btp-setup-automator:latest"
```

> âš  NOTE: If you are running on an ARM based platform like a Mac M1 or M2 and are facing issues with the image, add the `--platform linux/amd64` option to the `docker container run command`. The image we provide is built for `linux/amd64` and due to some implicit dependencies we cannot perform a built for `linux/arm64` with the alpine linux as base image.

Attach to the running container in VS Code as described in the SAP BTP Setup Automator documentation ([click here](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-setup-automator#get-the-docker-container-up-and-running)). Alternatively, you can also remove the **"-d"** parameter (detached mode) in the above command and execute the next steps (updating the parameters and usecase files) using your command line. 

Once you are started your container in the foreground or detached mode (and attached in VS Code in that case), please update the *parameters.json* and *uscase_basic_free_tier.json* files as described in the [**Change the configuration**](#change-the-configuration) section. You can find both files in the */home/user/usecases/released/discoverycenter/4064-cap-saas-cf/* directory of your container instance. After updating the files, you can run the main script `btpsa` with the following command (in case of **Basic Scope** deployment to **Free Tier**).

```bash
./btpsa -parameterfile 'usecases/released/discoverycenter/4064-cap-saas-cf/parameters.json' -usecasefile 'usecases/released/discoverycenter/4064-cap-saas-cf/usecase_basic_free_tier.json' -globalaccount '<your global account subdomain as shown in the SAP BTP cockpit>' -myemail '<your email address>'
```

The SAP BTP Setup automator script will now prepare your SAP BTP account to cover the use-case. You can have a look at the usecase.json files and [parameters.json](parameters.json) file for more details about the used services and configuration parameters (e.g. DB Password for SAP HANA Cloud).


## Troubleshooting

### How can I use an existing subaccount?

If you already have an existing subaccount you can either change the name in the parameters.json file directly in the running container or you can add it via the commandline when you run the script: 

```bash
./btpsa -subaccountname <Display Name of your existing subaccount>  
```

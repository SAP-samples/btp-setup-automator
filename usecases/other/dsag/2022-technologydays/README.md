# Instructions for setting up DSAG Technology Days hands-on in btp-setup-automator

The [btp-setup-automator](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-setup-automator) is an open source project to help developers setting-up their SAP BTP accounts quickly via various command line interfaces.

## Pre-Requisites

To use the [btp-setup-automator](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-setup-automator) you first need to finish the following tasks:

- Get an [SAP BTP trial account](https://cockpit.hanatrial.ondemand.com/trial/#/home/trial) or a [productive SAP BTP account](https://account.hana.ondemand.com/#/home/welcome) (recommended) where you can make use of the free tier service plans
- [Install a Docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)

> ⚠ NOTE: Be aware of the terms of Docker for usage in enterprises. For details see this [link](https://www.docker.com/blog/updating-product-subscriptions/).

## Context

The files in this folder are linked to the hands-on tutorial that will be presented at DSAG Technology Days 2022. You find the complete description in the SAP Samples repository ["Kyma Runtime Extension"](https://github.com/SAP-samples/kyma-runtime-extension-samples/tree/main/dsagtt22).

One component of this hands-on is the setup of the SAP Event Mesh as described in [step 4](https://github.com/SAP-samples/kyma-runtime-extension-samples/blob/main/dsagtt22/tutorial/step4.md) of the hands-on. The files in this directory contain the use case and the parameter files needed to do an automatic setup of this step.  

## Instructions

Open a command line terminal on your machine.

> 📝 Tip - In case you don't know how to do it, here are the instructions for [MS Windows](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-Terminal-in-Windows), [Mac OS](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Terminal-Window-in-Mac) and [Ubuntu Linux](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Terminal-Window-in-Ubuntu).

Enter the following command into the terminal and press the `ENTER` key:

```bash
docker container run --rm -it --name "btp-setup-automator" "ghcr.io/sap-samples/btp-setup-automator:latest"
```

> ⚠ NOTE: If you are running on an ARM based platform like a Mac M1 or M2 and are facing issues with the image, add the `--platform linux/amd64` option to the `docker container run command`. The image we provide is built for `linux/amd64` and due to some implicit dependencies we cannot perform a built for `linux/arm64` with the alpine linux as base image.

You'll notice that the prompt in your terminal has changed, because you are now working inside the docker container, that you just started.
Now run the main script `btpsa` with the following command:

```bash
./btpsa -parameterfile 'usecases/other/dsag/2022-technologydays/parameters.json' \
    -globalaccount 'your_global_account_subdomain_as_shown_in_the_SAP_BTP_cockpit'  \
    -region        'region_for_your_subaccount_eg_us10' \
    -myemail       'your_email_address'
```

The tool starts to execute and the only thing you need to type-in is your password for your SAP BTP account. The btp-setup-automator script will now prepare your SAP BTP account to cover the discovery center mission.

> ⚠ NOTE: In case you don't have the rights to create your own sub account, you should add the sub account id as a parameter to the command. That should look like this:

```bash
./btpsa -parameterfile 'usecases/other/dsag/2022-technologydays/parameters.json' \
    -globalaccount 'your_global_account_subdomain_as_shown_in_the_SAP_BTP_cockpit'  \
    -subaccountid  'your_sub_account_id_as_shown_in_the_SAP_BTP_cockpit'
    -region        'region_for_your_subaccount_eg_us10' \
    -myemail       'your_email_address'
```

This command will create:

- the Event Mesh service
- the Event Mesh application (for UI access)
- the service keys to access the Event Mesh service

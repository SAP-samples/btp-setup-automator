# Use Cases

You find several use cases in the folder [`/usecases/releases`](../usecases/released) that you can use *per se* or as a blueprint for your own scripts.

This file gives you an overview on the content of the different scenarios.

> âš  NOTE: You find more use cases and parameters files in the folder [`/usecases`](../usecases), however only the ones available in the directory `released` are tested by us and should work.

Remember, that the built-in json schemas allow you creating your own use case file quite easy. The only thing you need to do is to add the link to the json schema to your json file as shown in this video (the link to the schema can be found at the top of each usecase file).
